cf01 -- C-Flat Library Version 01

C-Flat is a project encompassing various programming tools, most of
which remain undeveloped as of March 2023.  cf00 is the version of 
C-flat implemented in C.  It is barely started.  For more information,
see commit e42fae1756c3e54786300e86e4895809bc39e62c.

cf01 is the version implemented in C++.  In 2021, the first tool of
practical use was implemented: Auto-Assert.

Auto-Assert attempts to automate much of the following debugging cycle.
 1. Bug is detected.  Program crashes or produces wrong output, etc.
 2. Add debug code & assertions.
 3. Re-run.
 4. Add debug code & assertions.
 5. re-run
 ...
 6. Bug is found.
 7. Bug is fixed.
 8. Add code to check bug is fixed.
 9. Re-run.
 10. Remove  debug code & assertions.
 11. Re-run.

Auto-Assert works as follows.  The programmer places assertions and
extra debug code using cf01 functions and/or macros.  These functions
and macros include hints indicating when such assertions and debug
code should be executed.  Some assertions are cheap and could be run
always, some are expensive and hence should be run rarely. The cf01 module
does the bookkeeping, keeping track of which assertions are run and
pass/fail status.  

When an assertion fails, cf01 stores some assertion information in a file.
Then, when the program is re-started, cf01 reads this file, enabling more
assertions and debug code, targeted to occur just prior to the failing
assertion.  Then the program is re-run, possibly triggering an earlier
assertion.  This process continues until the bug is found.

Ideally, the programmer's task becomes adding or modifying assertions and
debug code.  And cf01 handles the enabling and disabling of this 
additional code, which normally happens by simply re-running the application
without re-building.
